9 out of the 91. That was the female-to-male student ratio when I started to study Computer Science during my undergraduate. Mostly dominated by my male classmates, I began to feel less confident and doubted my future as a woman in computing. With a deep passion for painting at an early age, I thought maybe it could be a more sensible decision to switch to a different career path such as arts or design. It was during this trying time that I came across a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/danielle_feinberg_the_magic_ingredient_that_brings_pixar_movies_to_life?language=en) by Danielle Feinberg, Pixar‚Äôs director of photography. She spoke about her path to becoming a woman in engineering and a computer scientist who combines both art and technology at Pixar. As she mentioned, for a girl who wants to work in engineering, natural curiosity and passion can make any other challenge surpassable. I was inspired by the talk, and I have faith that if I find my unique passion, I could realize my achievement in the field of computing in my endeavors.

With renewed confidence, in my junior year, I attended the research group on Big Data Mining of Open-Source Software (OSS) Communities. During the literature review, I came across the paper [Competence-Confidence Gap: A Threat to Female Developers‚Äô Contribution on GitHub](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8445162). As a socio-technical system, GitHub users inherit historical bias and prejudice towards women. Further efforts need to be made for developers to collaborate and contribute and make a positive impact on the OSS community. I discovered my interest in analytics and developing tools for a more inclusive OSS development community for different genders, races, and personalities. Through my 3 years of research, I performed data analytics on the GitHub issue tracking system to study the social impacts among developers and developed a tool for monitoring the negative sentiments in Open-source software communities. The papers are accepted and presented at SEKE 2020 and APSEC 2021.

Not limited to only academic studies and research, I seek every opportunity to build a more friendly environment for learning and development in Tech. After my undergraduate study, instead of becoming a software developer at IT companies, I chose to work as a full-time high school Artificial Intelligence teacher. It might seem difficult for high school students to learn AI, especially for female students who are believed to do well in liberal arts rather than sciences. Therefore, I developed the course and designed in-class activities based on my perspective as a female student trying to understand new complex technologies. Converting the complex technical principles to something intuitive to high school students, leading them to enjoy the process of learning machine learning and thus igniting their passion for further studies in CS, that process gave me a strong sense of fulfillment. 

In addition, as a continuation of my passion for education, during this summer break, I am working as a computer science instructor at iD Tech camp, covering topics in C++, Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, Video Production, and Animation. By personalizing the project topics and lesson plans tailored to each student‚Äôs interests and advantages, I aim to help them discover the beauty of computer technology by constructing realistic tech works through trial and error and ultimately making a difference in the world around us. I believe this process has a deep impact on them, empowering them to pursue higher goals in their future technical career paths. I am building strong relationships with my female students through these experiences.

With a passion for CS and OSS development, my ultimate goal is to **cultivate a more inclusive and friendly environment for both learning and development in Tech**. The unconfident girl intimidated by the number 9 out of 91 was left forever in the past, and the joint support and efforts would continuously inspire me, as well as each individual, further along the road ahead to foster a better environment for Women in Tech.
