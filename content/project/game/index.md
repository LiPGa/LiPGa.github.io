[Switch Witch](https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/temp/showcase/gallery/switch_witch/) is a light strategy game in the medieval fantasy world setting. It provides players with an easy-to-play but challenging-to-master experience. The target players are those who enjoy aspects of war games and strategic thinking who can play one quick level or can grind through many levels in one sitting. The player will identify with a witch striving to defend her homeland using the swapping mechanic to kill the king of the three kingdoms.
