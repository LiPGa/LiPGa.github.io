Works for CS6630: Realistic Image Synthesis, a PhD-level class instructed by Steve Marschner at Cornell University. 

<!-- {{< figure src="featured.png" width="400px">}} -->

Implemented the Monte Carlo path tracer with various integration methods such as direct light and global illumination with BSDF, light sampling and multiple importance sampling. Implemented additional features including volumetric path tracing, microfacet scattering, dispersion, various materials and more.
